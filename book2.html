      <h2>About Node.js</h2>
      <p>
        Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build scalable
        network applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
        lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications.
